This food donation system is a web-based platform designed to connect individuals and organizations with surplus food to those in need. 
Users can easily donate food items or search for available donations in their area.
This system aims to reduce food waste, promote sustainability and help address food insecurity in the community. 
In developing this system I used python technology.
